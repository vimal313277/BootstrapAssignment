#### What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

---

1. Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

2. If you do not want to use all 12 column you can group the columns together to create wider columns

3. Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout, which provides flexibility in designing responsive web pages. Developers can allocate these columns to different content sections to create layouts that adapt well to various screen sizes and devices. It's a powerful tool for creating responsive designs effciantly.

example:-

     <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4"></div>
      <div class="col-md-4"></div>
      <div class="col-md-4"></div>
    </div>
